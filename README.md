##Machine Learning Projects (Stanford Machine Learning by Andrew Ng)

 Note: The project templates were created by Andrew Ng and team in MATLAB Code
 with a "YOUR CODE HERE" section in which you are instructed to implement the ML 
 Algorithm that is related to that weeks lecture  (for more detail click on the 
 exercise instruction document)

 The projects focused on learning to implement Machine Learning Algorithms while
 providing rational models for determining how to address real world machine learning 
 problems in practical situations. The models were organized under three categories: 

###Advice for Applying Machine Learning Algorithms:###
 
* Evaluating Hypothesis
* Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets
* Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance
* Regularization and Bias/ Variance
* Learning Curves

###Machine Learning System Design:###
 
* Prioritizing What to Work on Next
* Error Analysis
* Error Metrics for Skewed Classes
* Trading Off Precision and Recall
* Data For Machine Learning
  
###Ceiling Analysis: What part of the Pipeline to Work on Next###
 
* Determining the error due to each component in a ML System
* Deciding where in ML System Pipeline to spend your effort 
  given a resource constrained environment
