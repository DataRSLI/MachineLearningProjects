##Machine Learning Projects(Stanford Machine Learning by ProfessorAndrew Ng)
 
 The projects listed in this repository focused on learning to implement 
 Machine Learning Algorithms in a rational and efficient manner. Professor Ng 
 offered advice through three general approaches for applying the tools  
 learned in the course in real world situations: 

###Advice for Applying Machine Learning Algorithms:###
 
* Evaluating Hypothesis
* Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets
* Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance
* Regularization and Bias/ Variance
* Learning Curves

###Machine Learning System Design:###
 
* Prioritizing What to Work on Next
* Error Analysis
* Error Metrics for Skewed Classes
* Trading Off Precision and Recall
* Data For Machine Learning
  
###Ceiling Analysis: What part of the Pipeline to Work on Next###
 
* Determining the error due to each component in a ML System
* Deciding where in ML System Pipeline to spend your effort given a resource constrained environment 
* Example:What Part of the pipeline should you spend the most time trying to improve?        
ML System Component | Component Accuracy
------------------- | ------------------
 Overall System     |    72%
 Text Detection     |    89%
 Character Segmentation| 90%
  Character recognition|  100%

 **Important Note:** The project templates were created by Andrew Ng and team in MATLAB Code
 with a "YOUR CODE HERE" section which is where you will find my implementation.
